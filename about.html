        <h3>Fullstack Rookie</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Ronny Bruhin and I am a Fullstack Developer Rookie. I
          started my apprenticeship in August 2023 and really enjoy it. Don't
          hesitate to contact me if you have any questions.
        </p>

        <p>
          Outside of work, I find joy in a variety of fulfilling hobbies. You
          might find me taking leisurely walks with my dogs, savoring the
          tranquility of nature. At home, I indulge in nurturing my passion for
          technology by tinkering with my homeserver setup, ensuring everything
          runs smoothly. The art of bonsai captivates me, offering a blend of
          patience and creativity as I meticulously care for miniature trees.
          Gardening in all its forms brings me contentment; whether it's
          cultivating vibrant blooms or growing fresh produce, I revel in
          nurturing life from seed to fruition. Additionally, I delve into the
          world of 3D printing, exploring its limitless possibilities and
          bringing digital designs to tangible reality. These pursuits not only
          enrich my downtime but also reflect my diverse interests and
          dedication to continuous learning and creativity.
        </p>

        <p>
          After nearly 15 years in construction, specializing as a plumber and
          heating system installer, I've finally stepped into the role I've
          always aspired to. Transitioning into this new chapter of my career
          has been a rewarding journey, filled with the satisfaction of pursuing
          my passion. Now, I'm fully immersed in software development, where
          every day brings new opportunities to thrive and grow professionally.
          This career change not only represents a culmination of years of hard
          work and dedication but also signifies a fulfilling leap into a role
          that truly resonates with my ambitions and interests.
